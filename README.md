# synoptic-SOM
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/500991505.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13864055)

## Overview
This reposity contains a python implementation of the Self-Organizing Map (Kohonen 1990) for applications in synoptic climatology, developed for the 
paper "Investigating Climate Drivers of Lightning in Alaska with a SOM-RF". Also included are the weights of the sea level pressure (SLP) and 500hPa 
geopoential height (Z) SOM nodes, and a csv table of the daily synoptic types derived from the SOM for June-July during the 2004-2022 period.

## Computational Requirements

### Software Requirments
This library is entirely contained within Python and CUDA (implicitly via the cupy library). The environment to execute 
the synoptic-SOM can be set up in conda with the provided requirements.txt. Additionally, some helper functions are included
in the geospatial_utils.py file.

### Memory and Runtime
This toolkit was last run on 9-30-2024 on a Windows 11 PC with an AMD Ryzen 9 3900x, 32GB of RAM, and an RTX2080. Time to train a 4x5 SOM on daily pressure fields for June-July of the 2004-2022 period is about 1 hour. Current implementation requires an Nvidia GPU with CUDA enabled.

### Example
See "Training SOMs.ipynb" for an example of a scripted application of this toolkit.
